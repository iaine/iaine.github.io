<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>The University of Oxford e-Research Centre and Centre for Digital Scholarship are delighted to announce a day's symposium on sonification.</strong></p>

<p>
Sounds surround us everywhere, and in our urban and industrial environments we are permanently immersed in music and noise—alarms, vending machines, phones have familiarized us with mechanical sound as signal. Sonifications, or audiograms, are attracting attention as a method of re-presenting data, yet this area of study continues to be less studied than, for example, visual analytics.</p>
<p>
The celebrations of Ada Lovelace’s 200th birthday demonstrated a larger interest in the intersection of machinery, music, and culture, and pushed existing disciplinary boundaries. The symposium will build on this and we look forward to developing ideas and approaches together.</p>

<p>We invite proposals for papers (including audio-papers) and posters on sound, its production, reception, public engagement, technologies, sonic re-presentation, and exploration of the sonic world from all fields of research and learning</p>

 <h2>When is it?</h2>
 <p>10:00–16:00, 21 April 2017<br />
